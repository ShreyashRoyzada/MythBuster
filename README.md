# MythBuster - Combatting prevalent myths with fun!

<p align="center"><img src="./help_assets/logo-whitebg.png"/></p>

## Overview and Social Impact
Myth Buster is our game which encourages you and teaches you about the different myths prevalent in the society we live in, making us more socially aware while enjoting a fun and healthy game of agility! In these trying times of Covid-19, we've learnt to value the virtual interactions as well, this is a two-player game that we're willing to extend to multiple players in the future, so that you and your pals can have fun together! This togetherness, can also potentially open a dialogue about these prevalent myths in rather comfortable manner, by virtue of sportsmanship!

## Challenges
A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor! We're glad to acknowledge our learnings through the process.

* Choosing the platform to build the game took a good while, as we were adamant about integrating it in a web application for easy access. We started of with *Unity* but had to make a shift to *p5.js* due to its simplicity as well as our team dynamic. This shift did cost us some valuable time which made the project completion in the deadline more challenging!
* It was our first time integrating a game into a web application and so did run into a few unpredictable situations!
* Involving multiple players in one game over the server we were working on turned out to be a little hard to understand situation. Testing the same when we both are "virtually" next to each other is yet another challenge, hampering reliability to some extent.
* We ran into some browser specific issues while trying to run our webpage locally, especially while rendering the game as some browsers do not loading of local resource (`Not allowed to load local resource`).
* The objects that are visually big in size, might be treated as point objects for mouse clicks in `p5.js`, decreasing the playability of the game.
